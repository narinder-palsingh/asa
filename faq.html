									<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A:</b></font> We like to give all 
									the time you deserve to diagnose the problem with your appliance 
									properly. In order to do this, we must give you a &#8220;window&#8221; 
									because we don&#8217;t know how long the appointment before yours will 
									take. We hate to give you a specific time and then not be able

									What about nighttime or weekend service? </a></b></p>
									<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A:</b></font> Most of our 
									technicians are family people and like to spend evenings and 
									weekends with their families. These highly trained technicians 
									work hard during normal business hours and do not want to make a 
									mistake because they are tired. There is, however, evening and 
									Saturday service available at a slight additional charge in 
									order to provide an incentive to the technicians. If we are not 
									opened when you call, please leave a voice mail, and our service 
									will alert a manager on duty as to your request and you will get 
									a call back.

									<a href=" #Frequently_Asked_Questions" name="Does_it_pay_to_fix_the_old_machine_or_should_we_just_purchase_a_new_one_">
									Does it pay to fix the old machine or should we just purchase a 
									new one? </a></b></p>
									<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A:</b></font> This is a very good 
									question, and is asked quite often. Unfortunately the answer is 
									not clear cut. If your appliance is several years old, chances 
									are it was made better than most of the new ones available 
									(including major brands). In most cases, since you know it has 
									been a good appliance, it pays to fix it; especially if a new 
									appliance costs considerably more than a repair. Additionally, 
									many times there are reasons why your appliance stopped working 
									and our trained technicians can point these things out so that 
									repairs will be required less frequently.

									Can you provide us with an estimate (ball park figure) for the 
									repair over the phone? </a></b></p>
									<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A:</b></font> Unfortunately there 
									are usually up to a dozen different reasons why the same 
									symptoms occur. Without being able to diagnose the appliance, 
									using our knowledge, experience and test equipment, all we can 
									do is guess. Many companies will quote an approximate price over 
									the phone (usually low enough to attract your attention) and 
									when their people arrive you find out that the repair is far 
									more based on what they find than you were told over the phone 
									and you are still responsible for the service charge.

									Why doesn&#8217;t anybody want to repair our appliance because we 
									bought the parts ourselves?</a></b> </p>
									<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A:</b></font> Not very often, but 
									often enough, a part is delivered (either to you or us) and 
									although brand-new, it is defective. If we supply the part 
									(which is approximately the same amount of money as you would 
									pay) if it doesn&#8217;t work we are responsible for replacing that 
									part with one that does work. If we install your part, we have 
									done our job and if it doesn&#8217;t work we still require payment.

									<b>Why have we been told that repair companies will not work on 
									our appliance if we started taking it apart ourselves?</b> </a>
									</p>
									<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A:</b></font> That is a fair 
									question, and the reason seems to escape most people. If you 
									dismantle anything on your appliance and then find that you need 
									professional help, we would have to put the appliance back 
									together in order to diagnose the exact symptoms properly. Even 
									if you put your own appliance back together, the technician has 
									no roadmap in his mind of just how the appliance was put back 
									together, and you could have done it incorrectly. This leads to 
									a large amount of time to second-guess what is causing the 
									problem and a larger bill for our customers because we end up 
									doing twice the work.

									<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A:</b></font> Before our technicians 
									leave your premises, they will attempt to go over all functions 
									of the appliance to have you make sure that it is working 
									properly. Even by doing that, occasionally the appliance will 
									cease to work again. Rest assured that we will make our return 
									visit to you a top priority and you will receive service before

									Why does it cost so much to fix my appliance? </a></b></p>
									<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A:</b></font> To begin, all of our 
									technicians have been formally schooled in appliance repair. 
									Anyone can keep changing parts (at your expense) if they do not 
									know what they are doing or do not have the proper test 
									equipment. Next there is the technicians amount of experience. 
									Before our technicians are sent to your home by themselves, they 
									must complete a satisfactory evaluation with one of our senior 
									technicians. Additionally, your technician is paid a very good 
									salary for his knowledge and experience while he is driving to 
									your home and while he is diagnosing the problem. Also, they 
									carry with them an extensive inventory of parts in order to 
									repair your appliance with just the one visit. If your appliance 
									requires parts that are not common, and have to be ordered, we 
									will make every attempt to secure these parts as quickly as 
									possible (we have many sources) and return to complete the 
									repair promptly. A small deposit will be required and the 
									balance due upon completion.

									<a href=" #Frequently_Asked_Questions" name="Your_technician_was_only_here_a_short_period_of_time_or_he_only_used_a_small_part._Why_was_I_charged_so_much_">
									<b>Your technician was only here a short period of time or he 
									only used a small part. Why was I charged so much?</b> </a></p>
									<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A:</b></font> A repair to your 
									appliance is calculated using the technicians knowledge and 
									experience and (in most cases) immediate access to parts. 
									Additionally, most requests for service are tended to the same 
									day or the very next day. When a technician works on your 
									appliance he gives you a price before starting the work. Neither 
									the price of the part nor the amount of time spent is a major 
									factor. You are paying for knowledge to repair your appliance 
									properly and our ability to return if any work under warranty is 
									necessary.

									<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A:</b></font> Before we start any

									permitted to enter a home with only minor children in 
									attendance. An adult must be present.

									<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>A:</b></font> In very few instances 
									there is a secondary problem that cannot be detected until the

									refrigerator/freezer is not cooling at all and after repair it 
									cools perfectly but the icemaker doesn&#8217;t work. In these cases 
									the secondary repair will be done for the price of the parts 
									only or if a difficult additional repair is necessary it will be 
									done at a nominal charge.&nbsp;
