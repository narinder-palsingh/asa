									<h2><a name="Refrigerator"></a>REFRIGERATOR REPAIR TIPS</h2>
									<h3 >If your refrigerator is not running or is not cold enough...</h3>
									<p class="oList">1. Turn the thermostat up to the next highest setting. If it comes on, let it run for 24 hours and check temperature to confirm it is working properly. </p>
									<p class="oList" >2. Clear/remove anything blocking the air flow around the outside of the refrigerator (on top, underneath, behind, beside, in front of, etc.). Allow 3&quot; of clearance all the way around.</p>
									<p class="oList">3. If there are condenser coils on the rear of the box, make sure the box is several inches from the wall and that nothing is on top at the rear, blocking the heat from coming off the coils.</p>
									<p class="oList">4. If the condenser coils are underneath the refrigerator, clean the coils with a vacuum cleaner thoroughly at least twice a year.</p>
									<h3 >If the door is sticking or not closing properly...</h3>
									<p class="oList" >1. Wipe off the face of the gasket with a wet rag and make sure the interior shelves, drawers and food are not preventing the door from closing from the inside.</p>
									
									<h2><a name="Stove"></a>STOVE REPAIR TIPS</h2>
									<h3>Electric - If your burners are not heating...</h3>
									<p class="oList" >1. Make sure they are sitting straight in their proper positions.</p>
									<h3 >Electric - If your oven is not heating... </h3>
									<p class="oList">1. Make sure the clock is set on manual cycle and not the automatic time bake cycle. </p>
									<h3 >Gas - If the top burners are not lighting... </h3>
									<p class="oList" >1. Wipe off the burner with a hot, damp rag and then dry completely. </p>
									<h3 >Gas - If your oven is not heating... </h3>
									<p class="oList" >1. Make sure the clock is set on the manual and not the automatic cycle. </p>
									<p class="oList" >2. Raise up the top and keep the area clean and free of grease build-up. </p>
									
									<h2 ><a name="Dishwasher"></a>DISHWASHER REPAIR TIPS  </h2>
									<h3 >If the dishes are not getting clean... </h3>
									<p class="oList">1. Make sure the water is hot enough. It should be at least 140 degrees, which is hot enough to burn you - VERY HOT! If it is not hot enough, turn the hot water heater thermostat up to a higher setting. </p>
									<p class="oList">2. Make sure the lower spray arm is unobstructed and turning freely. </p>
									<p class="oList" >3. Make sure the bottom inside the dishwasher is clean and free of debris. </p>
									<p class="oList" >4. Make sure you are following the proper loading procedures. Use the proper amount of detergent and make sure the detergent is fresh (check expiration or &quot;best if used by&quot; date. </p>
									<h3>If the door isn&apos;t closing... </h3>
									<p class="oList" >1. Make sure the latch assembly is unrestricted and latching properly. Make sure nothing is blocking the door from opening and closing properly. </p>
									<h3 >If the unit is leaking... </h3>
									<p class="oList" >1. Make sure you are following the proper loading procedures, including proper type and amounts of detergents. Run the unit through cycle while empty - if it doesn&apos;t leak, it&apos;s probably a loading problem. </p>
									<p class="oList" >2. Make sure the racks are positioned properly. </p>
									<p class="oList">3. Make sure the door is unrestricted around the opening. </p>
									<p class="oList"<strong><strong><em>Tech Tip</em></strong><em>&nbsp;- If the inside of your dishwasher is begriming to brown and form mineral stains, put Limeaway (available at your grocery store) or Tang Citrus Drink into the tank draining the wash cycle. The citric acid from these products will remove the mineral buildup and restore the finish.</em> </p>
									<p class="oList"><strong><em>Tech Tip</em></strong><em>&nbsp;- If your dishwasher is developing a film on the inside, put 6-7 drops of good-quality, name brand regular liquid detergent (for hand washing dishes) in the bottom and put the machine through a regular cycle. This procedure will wash away soap scum, mineral deposits and grit. It will also allow the machine to work better. IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not put more than 6-7 drops of liquid detergent. Be proactive, prevent potential floods!</em> </p>
									
									<h2 ><a name="Washer"></a>WASHER REPAIR TIPS  </h2>
									<h3 >If machine is dead... </h3>
									<p class="oList" >1. Make sure the lid is closed properly. </p>
									<p class="oList" >2. Make sure the timer and all of the controls are set properly. </p>
									<p class="oList" >3. Make sure both water faucets are turned on. </p>
									<p class="oList" ><strong><em>Tech Tip</em></strong><em>&nbsp;- Follow the proper loading procedure and machine operation.</em> </p>

									<h2 ><a name="Dryer"></a>DRYER REPAIR TIPS  </h2>
									
									<h3 >If the clothes are not getting dry... </h3>
									<p class="oList" >1. Make sure the dryer is not pushed back against the rear exhaust duct causing an air flow restriction. </p>
									<p class="oList">2. Make sure the clothes are coming out of the washer spun damp dry. If the washer is not spinning the clothes damp dry, the dryer will not dry the clothes in a normal amount of time. </p>
									
									<p class="oList" ><strong><em>Tech Tip</em></strong><em>&nbsp;- Follow the proper loading procedure and machine operation.</em> </p>
									
									<p class="oList" ><strong><em>Tech Tip</em></strong><em>&nbsp;- Never overload the dryer.</em> </p>

									<p class="oList" >1. Turn the unit off. After turning the unit off, remove anything that has fallen into the grinding chamber. </p>
									<p class="oList" >2. Turn the unit off. After turning the unit off, insert an &quot;un jamming&quot; tool into the bottom and turn clockwise. Once the tool turns freely, remove whatever was causing the jam. </p>
									<p class="oList" s>3. If the unit is dead, press the red reset button located on the bottom of the disposal - if the unit begins to hum and the reset trips again, it is still jammed. Repeat step #2 and #3. </p>
									<p class="oList" ><strong><em>Tech Tip</em></strong><em>&nbsp;- Always run water in the sink when you operate the unit.</em> </p>
									
									
									<h2><a name="Freezer"></a>FREEZER REPAIR TIPS</h2>
									
									<h3>If the unit is not self-defrosting and the temperatures begin to rise...</h3>
									
									<p class="oList" >1. Check the frost buildup on the inside of the freezer. If it is heavily frosted, manually defrost the freezer by turning it off at the thermostat. Unplug from the wall and allow 12 hours for the unit to defrost, with both doors open.</p>
									
									<h3>If the unit is not an automatic self-defrosting model...</h3>
									
									<p class="oList">1. Defrost the unit once a year or as often as needed. Follow the proper defrosting methods. DO NOT USE a knife, pick, hammer, chisel, screwdriver, etc. or any sharp object)</p>
